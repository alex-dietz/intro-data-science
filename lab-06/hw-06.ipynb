    "Reproduce with the components of the IMD for Liverpool and compare the output with the distribution of the IMD scores (the data is available in previous labs 4 and 5). This involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read in the data.\n",
    "* Create a geodemographic classification for Liverpool using K-means and all the components of the IMD (income, employment, education, health, crime, and housing). This is composed of:\n",
    "    * Run K-means.\n",
    "    * Extract the labels.\n",
    "    * Plot the classes on a map.\n",
    "    * Compare the map obtained from the geodemographic classification with the distribution of the IMD scores.\n",
    "* Create a regionalization with the same attribute variables as for the geodemographic classification and producing 60 resulting observations. This will involve:\n",
    "    * Create the weights for the LSOA geography.\n",
    "    * Run the regionalisation algorithm (e.g. spatially constrained hierarchical clustering).\n",
    "    * Extract the labels and plot them on a map.\n",
    "    * Compare the resulting map with that of the MSOAs geography, which is available on the Census data pack under lab 02 datasets `lab-01/data/Liverpool/shapefiles/Liverpool_msoa11.shp`."
